# Imputers

!!! tip "What is the Imputer module?"
    The `imputer` module is responsible for handling missing data in geospatial datasets, dealing with missing information of latitude-longitude data columns or geometry specified in [WKT format](https://libgeos.org/specifications/wkt/).

    Meanwhile, we recommend to look through the [`Example`'s Imputer](../copy_of_examples/1-Per-Module/3-imputer/) for a more hands-on introduction about
    the Imputer module and its usage.

!!! warning "Documentation Under Alpha Construction"
    **This documentation is in its early stages and still being developed.** The API may therefore change, 
    and some parts might be incomplete or inaccurate.  

    **Use at your own risk**, and please report anything that seems `incorrect` / `outdated` you find.
