# Pipeline

!!! tip "What is the pipeline tool?"
    The `pipeline` tool is a module that allows you to create a sequence of data processing steps, or "pipeline", 
    to transform your `urban layer` given one or more `urban datasets` and some user-defined `enrichments`.

    Meanwhile, we highly recommend to look through the [`Examples`'s Pipeline](../copy_of_examples/1-Per-Module/7-urban_pipeline/) for a more hands-on introduction about
    the pipeline tool and its usage.

!!! warning "Documentation Under Alpha Construction"
    **This documentation is in its early stages and still being developed.** The API may therefore change, 
    and some parts might be incomplete or inaccurate.  

    **Use at your own risk**, and please report anything that seems `incorrect` / `outdated` you find.
