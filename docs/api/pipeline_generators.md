# Pipeline Generators

!!! note "Optional module"
    Install the `pipeline_generators` extra before generating pipelines via LLMs:

    - `pip install urban-mapper[pipeline_generators]`
    - `uv add urban-mapper --group pipeline_generators`

!!! tip "What is the Pipeline Generator module?"
    The `Pipeline Generator` module is solving the following scenario, imagine telling `UrbanMapper` exactly what 
    urban analysis you want, and watching it craft a pipeline for you—no coding required. Powered by 
    `Large Language Models (LLMs)`, this module transforms your natural language descriptions into executable 
    Python code for `UrbanMapper` pipelines.

    Meanwhile, we recommend to look through the [`Example`'s Pipeline Generator](../copy_of_examples/1-Per-Module/8-pipeline_generator/) for a more hands-on introduction about
    the Pipeline Generator module and its usage.

!!! warning "Documentation Under Alpha Construction"
    **This documentation is in its early stages and still being developed.** The API may therefore change, 
    and some parts might be incomplete or inaccurate.  

    **Use at your own risk**, and please report anything that seems `incorrect` / `outdated` you find.
