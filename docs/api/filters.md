# Filters

!!! tip "What is the Filter module?"
    The `filter` module is responsible for filtering geospatial datasets based on specific criteria or conditions out 
    of your `urban layer` and based on information of latitude-longitude data columns or geometry specified in [WKT format](https://libgeos.org/specifications/wkt/).

    Meanwhile, we recommend to look through the [`Example`'s Filter](../copy_of_examples/1-Per-Module/4-filter/) for a more hands-on introduction about
    the Filter module and its usage.


!!! warning "Documentation Under Alpha Construction"
    **This documentation is in its early stages and still being developed.** The API may therefore change, 
    and some parts might be incomplete or inaccurate.  

    **Use at your own risk**, and please report anything that seems `incorrect` / `outdated` you find.
