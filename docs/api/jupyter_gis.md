# Jupyter GIS (JGIS) Mixin

!!! note "Optional module"
    Install the `jupytergis_mixins` extra to unlock these collaborative GIS tools:

    - `pip install urban-mapper-community[jupytergis_mixins]`
    - `uv add urban-mapper-community --group jupytergis_mixins`

!!! tip "What is Jupyter GIS Mixin?"
    The `Jupyter GIS` mixin is responsible to deliver a way to explore your UrbanMapper's pipeline in a more
    collaborative in real-time manner within your Jupyter Notebooks' workflow via the great JGIS.

    See more about Jupyter GIS, in [their documentation](https://jupyter-gis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

    A mixin, in this very instance, is nothing more than a class that connects external libraries for their use
    directly adapted towards the `UrbanMapper` workflow.

!!! warning "Documentation Under Alpha Construction"
    **This documentation is in its early stages and still being developed.** The API may therefore change, 
    and some parts might be incomplete or inaccurate.  

    **Use at your own risk**, and please report anything that seems `incorrect` / `outdated` you find.
