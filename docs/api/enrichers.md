# Enrichers

!!! tip "What is the enricher module?"
    The `enricher` module is the heart of `UrbanMapper`’s analysis—they take your `urban layer` and `transform it` into meaningful
    `statistics`, like `counting taxi pickups` at each `intersection` or `averaging building heights` per `neighborhood` given your loaded `urban data`.
    Meanwhile, we recommend to look through the [`Example`'s Enricher](../copy_of_examples/1-Per-Module/5-enricher/) for a more hands-on introduction about
    the enricher module and its usage.

!!! warning "Documentation Under Alpha Construction"
    **This documentation is in its early stages and still being developed.** The API may therefore change, 
    and some parts might be incomplete or inaccurate.  

    **Use at your own risk**, and please report anything that seems `incorrect` / `outdated` you find.

## Enricher Aggregators Functions For Faster Perusal

!!! note "In a Nutshell, How To Read That"
    An aggregation function is `name` followed by a `function` that takes a `list` of `values` and returns a single value.
    The ones below are the common we deliver, utilising mainly Pandas.
